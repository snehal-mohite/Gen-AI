Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) is a type of AI that can create new content, such as audio, images, text, code, videos etc.Is a subset of Deep Learning.

Artificial Intelligence:
                        Is a broad field of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent systems capable of performing tasks that typically reqires human intelligence.

    Machine Learning: 
                    Is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms
                    and models that enable computer to learn and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming.

                    Need:
                        Lot of training data.
                        Computational power.

        Deep Learning:
                    Is a subset of machine learning that focuses on teaching computers to learn and make decisions by processing data through neural networks inspired by the human brain.
                    Human Brain(neurons)->Neural Network Layers.(Multilayer Structure)

Machines need to be trained on large volume of data.
Shift to conversational, contextual understanding.

ChatGPT: 
       is a language model developed by OpenAI. It is designed for natural language understanding and generation, specifically in a conversational context(History Maintain).
       Trained on billions of documents.(Increase Accuracy)
       Based on Generative Pre-Trained Transformer(GPT) architecture, a type of neural network.
       Web interface for end-users, API for developers.
                            **-----Gen AI------**
Large Language Models(LLMs)(Deals Only with Text):
                           Are powerful artificial intelligence models designed for understanding and generating human-like text.
    Key Points on LLM:
       Pre-training - Trained on huge corpus of data.
       Size and scale - Massive Neural Networks.
       Fine-Tuning - More "Targeted" training for specific tasks.
    Use Cases for LLM:
      Content generation
	  Chatbots and virtual assistants
	  Language translation
	  Text summarization
	  Q & A
Prompt Engineering: 
    Prompt engineering is the process of crafting well-defined and structured input queries to interact with AI systems, in order to get accurate and relevant responses.        
        A prompt is a specific quesions, command or input that you provide to an AI system to request a particular response, information or action.(Example. How's the weather?)
    Best Practice for Prompt Engineering:
        Clearly convey the desired response.
        Provide context or background information.
        Balance simplicity and complexity.
        Iterative testing and refinement
Machines do not understand text they only understand numbers.
Embeddings :
    Embeddings are numerical representation of text.
    They are essential for AI models to understand and work with human language effectively.
Fine-tuning a LLM: Is the process of adapting a pre-trained model to perform specific tasks or to cater to a particular domain more effectively.

Retails: Give large data and take summary from that.
Marketing: Create Content.(like Emails, Blogs, Images, Articals, Product description etc)
